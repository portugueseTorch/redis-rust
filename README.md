# redis-rust
Redis server implementation in Rust

### Why
1. Why not?
2. Caching and databases in general are intersting, so implementing one from scratch seems like a fun way to deepen my knowledge.
3. Implementing a parser for RESP also gives me a change to read up on some best practices for serialization/deserialization, networking, parsing, among others.
4. Goal is to start small and eventually work up to, hopefully, an SQLite implementation.

### Usage
Just use the proper redis server, for crying out loud! Those guys know what they are doing.
